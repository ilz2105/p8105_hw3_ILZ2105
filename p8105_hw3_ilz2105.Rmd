__Problem 1__

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# load the data
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
instacart 
```

There are `r ncol(instacart)` columns and `rnrow(instacart)` rows in the `instacart` dataset. Som key variables are 
`product_name`, `aisle`, `department` and `aisle_id`. The data also tells us what hour in the day the order was made 
with the `order_hour_of_day` column and we can find out what day of the week the order was made from the `order_dow` 
column. The average time of day for orders is `r mean(pull(instacart, order_hour_of_day))` or about 1:30pm. 
We can see that `Bulgarian Yogurt` is located in aisle 120 in the `dairy eggs` department. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
#How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?
 instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are `r nrow(row)` aisles; `fresh vegetables` and `fresh fruits` are two of the most ordered from aisles. 
  
Below I made a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles 
with more than 10000 items ordered.

```{r, message = FALSE}
plot1 = instacart %>%
   count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
           ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n), y = n)) +
           geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,  hjust = 1)) +
   labs(title = "number of items ordered in each aisle")
plot1
```

Next I made a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, 
“dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. I included the number of times each item was ordered. 

```{r}
#make a plot 
instacart %>% 
  group_by(product_name, aisle) %>% 
  summarize(frequency = n()) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  filter(
    aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits"),
    min_rank(desc(frequency)) <= 3 ) %>% 
    arrange(frequency, aisle) %>%
  rename("product name" = product_name) %>% 
      knitr::kable(format = 'pandoc', main = "Popular Aisle Items")
```

  
Below I made a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream 
are ordered on each day of the week.

```{r}
#make a table
instacart %>% 
  select(product_name, order_hour_of_day, order_dow) %>% 
filter(
  product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    mutate(
      day = recode(order_dow, 
             `0` = "Sunday",
             `1` = "Monday",
             `2` = "Tuesday",
             `3` = "Wednesday",
             `4` = "Thursday",
             `5` = "Friday",
             `6` = "Saturday"
             )) %>% 
  select(product_name, mean_hour, day) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "mean_hour") %>% 
  rename("product name" = product_name) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = 'pandoc', main = "mean hour")
  
```

__Problem 2__

First, I did some data cleaning:

format the data to use appropriate variable names;
focus on the “Overall Health” topic
include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

#tidy the data
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  drop_na(response) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = as.factor(response),
    response = factor(response, levels =  c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
  ) %>% 
  select(-data_value_footnote, -location_id, -data_value_footnote_symbol) %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr,
         county = locationdesc)
brfss 
```


```{r, message = FALSE}
# year 2002
distinctlocation_2002 = brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>%
  distinct(state, county) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7) %>% 
  rename(locations = n)
distinctlocation_2002

# year 2010
distinctlocation_2010 = brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2010") %>%
  distinct(state, county) %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7) %>% 
  rename(locations = n)
distinctlocation_2010
```

In 2002, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA were observed at 7+ locations. 
In 2010 CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TC, WA were observed at 7+ locations. 

Next. I constructed a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, 
and a variable that averages the data_value across locations within a state. Then I made a “spaghetti” 
plot of this average value over time within a state 

```{r}
# make a spaghetti plot
excellent = brfss %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(
  average = mean(data_value)) %>%
  select(year, state, average) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average)) +
  geom_line(aes( group = state, color = state)) +
  labs(title = "'Excellent' responses over state",
       x = "year",
       y = "average %")+
  scale_y_continuous( breaks = c(10,20, 30),
                      labels = c("10", "20", "30"),
                      limits = c(10,30))
excellent

```

Then I made a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data_value 
for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

```{r}
#make a to panel plot
year_2006_2010 = brfss %>% 
filter(
  year %in% c( "2006","2010"), state == "NY") %>% 
  select(year, state, county, response, data_value) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, fill = response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~year)+
  labs(title = "responses in NY from 2006 and 2010",
       x = "response",
       y = "data value")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,  hjust = 1))
year_2006_2010
```

__Problem 3__

```{r}
# load data
accel = read_csv("./accel_data.csv")
accel
```


```{r, message = FALSE}
#clean data
tidy_accel = accel %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    new_day = if_else(day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",  "Thursday", "Friday"), "weekday", day),
    new_day = if_else(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", new_day)
  ) %>% 
select(week, day_id, day, new_day, activity_1:activity_1440)
  
tidy_accel

```
```{r}
#tidy with pivot
tidy_accel_2 = accel %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "day_activity",
    names_prefix = "activity",
    values_to = "counts"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    new_day = if_else(day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"), "weekday", day),
    new_day = if_else(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", new_day),
    day_activity = as.integer(day_activity)
  )  
tidy_accel_2

```

Above, I created a new variable `new_day` that tells me whether the `day` is a `weekend` or `weekday`. I 
kept all of the original columns, and did not choose to `pivot_longer` here because I wanted to be able 
to read my table by `day_id`. There are `r nrow(tidy_accel)` rows and `r ncol(tidy_accel)` columns in 
`accel`. The data shows activity over 24 hours for 35 days or 5 weeks. It goes from `activity_1` to `activity_1440` 
for every minute of the day, which I later condensed after `pivot_longer` into one column called `day_activity`. 

Using my tidied dataset, I aggregated accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

```{r,message = FALSE}
# total activity sum for each day
tidy_accel_2 %>%
  group_by(day_id, day, new_day) %>% 
  summarize(day_activity = sum(counts)) %>% 
  select(day_id, new_day, day_activity) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = 'pandoc', main = "total activity counts per day")
```

Activity appears to be higher on some Mondays and most weekends compared to Tuesday-Friday. There does not appear to be any distinct
trends in the data just from looking at the values for `day_activity` and comparing them to the `day`. The
weekdays seem pretty consistent in value for the most part, staying between 300,000 to 500,000 with some days going 
lower or higher. It is difficult to tell without looking at a plot. 


Below, I made a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day 
and used color to indicate day of the week.

```{r}
#plot attemp 1
activity_plot = tidy_accel %>% 
    pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "day_activity",
    values_to = "counts"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_activity , y = counts, group = day_id, color = day))+
  geom_line()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title = "Activity over 24 hours ")

activity_plot
```

This plot is very dificult to see anything so below I tried* to break up the xaxis and separate by days. 

```{r, plot}
#plot  attempt 
activity_plot = tidy_accel_2 %>% 
group_by(week, day, day_id, day_activity, counts) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_activity, y = counts, group = week , color = day))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600, 660, 720, 780, 
               840, 900, 960, 1120, 1180, 1240, 1300, 1360, 1420, 1440),
    
   labels = c("1" , "2" , "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13",
              "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", "19", "20", "21", "22", "23", "24"),
    limits = c(0, 1440)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title = "Activity over 24 hours ")

activity_plot 
```
